        ## Research Philosophy

        - **Bio-Inspired**: Drawing from nature's swarm systems (ants, bees, birds, fish)
        - **Scalable**: From small teams to large-scale swarms
        - **Robust**: Decentralized systems resilient to individual failures
        - **Adaptive**: Self-organizing behavior in dynamic environments
